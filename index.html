    <h2>Milwaukee's Center for Transformative Creative Arts and Hip Hop Culture!</h2>

    <p> Do you remember the days of your youth when you were excited to go to school, actually liked your teacher and wanted to learn? Today in Milwaukee, with one of the lowest high school graduation rates far too many young people see school as an obstacle rather than a means to success in life.
        TRUE Skool understands that we MUST create new solutions to old problems. Poverty, a troubled public school system, lack of positive opportunities and jobs for young peopleâ€¦things MUST change and we demand it happens now!

        <li>We understand how popular culture, specifically Hip Hop culture, has the power to provide unexplored opportunities for youth.
